Introduction:

This website will aim to better educate individuals about the carbon cost of what they eat. 
While there are the obvious carbon emisisons of different types of agriculture and animal agriculture products, 
it makes sense to also consider how the food industry's aggressive use of land and other factors. In addition to carbon emissions, 
nitrogen pollution stemming from fertilizers, the food industry's use of land hampers potential carbon sinks or reforestation efforts.
